What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

First, let's get the current date using Python.

```python
# python code
from datetime import date

# Get today's date
today = date.today()

print("Today's date:", today)
```

Next, we need to get the year-to-date (YTD) gain for META (Facebook) and TESLA. We can use the `yfinance` library in Python to get the stock prices.

Please install the library if you haven't done so by running `pip install yfinance` in your terminal.

Here is the Python code to get the YTD gain for META and TESLA.

```python
# python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current year
current_year = datetime.now().year

# Get the stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('META', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)

# Calculate the YTD gain
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100

print(f'META YTD Gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')
print(f'TESLA YTD Gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')
```

This code will print the YTD gain for META and TESLA in percentage. The gain is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price from the first trading day of the year to the most recent trading day.

I apologize for the oversight. The 'today' variable was defined in the first code block but not in the second one. Let's correct this by defining 'today' in the second code block as well. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, date

# Get the current year and today's date
current_year = datetime.now().year
today = date.today()
