To find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv, we can use the arXiv API. The API allows us to search for papers based on keywords. We will use the requests and feedparser libraries in Python to send a GET request to the API and parse the returned RSS feed.

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python
import requests
import feedparser

# Define the base URL for the arXiv API
base_url = 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?'

# Define the search parameters
search_params = 'search_query=all:gpt-4&start=0&max_results=1'

# Send a GET request to the arXiv API
response = requests.get(base_url + search_params)

# Parse the returned RSS feed
feed = feedparser.parse(response.content)

# Print the title and summary of the latest paper about GPT-4
for entry in feed.entries:
    print('Title: ', entry.title)
    print('Summary: ', entry.summary)
```

This code will print the title and summary of the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv.

After we have the paper, we can manually read it to find its potential applications in software. This step requires language skills and cannot be automated.

Please run the above Python code to find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv.

Title:  Can LLMs like GPT-4 outperform traditional AI tools in dementia
  diagnosis? Maybe, but not today
Summary:  Recent investigations show that large language models (LLMs), specifically
GPT-4, not only have remarkable capabilities in common Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks but also exhibit human-level performance on various
professional and academic benchmarks. However, whether GPT-4 can be directly
used in practical applications and replace traditional artificial intelligence
(AI) tools in specialized domains requires further experimental validation. In
this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs such as GPT-4 to outperform
traditional AI tools in dementia diagnosis. Comprehensive comparisons between
GPT-4 and traditional AI tools are conducted to examine their diagnostic
accuracy in a clinical setting. Experimental results on two real clinical
datasets show that, although LLMs like GPT-4 demonstrate pote
